      'Settlementet has run after-school programmes in Vesterbro for decades. Together, we\'re opening a new weekday space where kids aged 7 to 14 can do homework, play, and just be. The physical space is secured. What we haven\'t figured out yet is what the programme actually looks like, who runs it alongside Settlementet\'s staff, and what would make children who are new to Denmark feel genuinely at home there, not just accommodated.',

      'KVINFO has spent years connecting women who broke into male-dominated industries with those just starting out. We\'re building a mentorship programme specifically for young women in Vesterbro interested in trades: carpentry, plumbing, electrical, welding. We know there\'s demand. We have the organisational partnership. What we\'re still working out is the format, the matching process, and crucially what the women who would benefit from this actually say they need. We don\'t want to assume it.',
